# Vibe-based coding a Mars colony sim

In the style of Rimworld / Factorio / Stardew Valley, my favorite videogames â€“ I'm working on a mars colony simulator game.

I was inspired by @levelsio on X making his plane game using Cursor and Claude 3.7 sonnet. I'm doing the same, also using Bun as the runtime and Phaser as the framework for the game.

See my posts on X at https://x.com/gabe_bda for updates on the game's development!
